NuSOAP is a rewrite of SOAPx4, provided by NuSphere and Dietrich Ayala.
It is a set of PHP classes - no PHP extensions required - that allow developers to create and consume web services based on SOAP 1.1, WSDL 1.1 and HTTP 1.0/1.1.

Here, I am going to give a accurate representation of the original project, but add a composer manifest to it.
We've been using the library for years and we've not had issue with it.
